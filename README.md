SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO

By: Eileen Mitchell
-A Portfolio of most recent projects, and attempt at a website to help do so.

Technologies Used
-HTML
-CSS

Description
This website allows users to brows through my growing portfolio of coding projects. The website will be used in the future to house more projects as more come in, and will be used to link to a resume for recruiters to view, and links to relevant software websites and other professional and personal websites.

In order to scroll to work, just click on the item you are looking for on the top right hand corner of the screen. For example, if you would like to review my work portfolio, click work in the right hand corner and it will automatically take you to the work section of my page. 

To view my work, click on the image tags which will take you directly to relevant websites. This will continue to be updated as more projects are created.

Known Bugs
Formatting is not uniform when the media screen size is altered. This is something I will need more help understanding on how to fix my particular code in connection with the media screen feature, as it did not seem to work when I gave it a go. Best format is in full screen mode, however some screens make the left hand information tab (About me, Work, Contact Me) not align properly. More understanding of alternative coding options to gain uniform code would be required.
